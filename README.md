# Unofficial Codelists

[![Build Status](https://github.com/codeforIATI/Unofficial-Codelists/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/codeforIATI/Unofficial-Codelists/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

Third party (“replicated”) codelists that may be useful in conjunction with the [IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org), but are not replicated as part of [IATI’s non-embedded codelists](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded).

These codelists are available via Code for IATI’s [Replicated Codelists site](https://codelists.codeforiati.org).

## Policy for merging changes

Any changes should be reviewed before merging.

In the case of an automated PR (provided by `codelist-updater`), the same person can both review and merge the PR, as the PR should only contain changes that keep a codelist in sync with the source.
